Dependencies : python3
Python Modules used : numpy, pyfinite, pexpect

-To run the Assignment use the commands
	-> "make inputs" (this command will run getPlainText.py and getCipherText.py and generate a plaintext file and ciphertext file)
	-> "make run" (this command will run the decryption.py and will produce the password)

- the final password is "survdoorfd"

- There are total three python files used which are
	-> getPlainText.py
	-> getCipherText.py
	-> decryption.py

- inside the Makefile the command used is "python3 file_name.py"
